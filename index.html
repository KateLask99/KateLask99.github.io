    <section>
      <p>New York City is home to one of the most diverse food cultures in the world — a city of dumplings, bagels, jerk chicken, tacos, and Michelin stars. But behind the flavors lies an invisible system of health inspections that ensures what we eat is safe. In this project, we explore the patterns of restaurant inspections using NYC Open Data, revealing how timing, location, and cuisine all intersect to shape the city’s culinary safety net.</p>

     <section>
      <h2>When do inspections happen?</h2>
      <p>Health inspections are not randomly scattered throughout the year. In fact, they follow predictable rhythms, affected by policy, logistics, and even the weather.</p>
      <iframe src="assets/interactive/Monthly_restaurant_Inspections_by_borough.html" style="width: 1070px; height: 600px; border: none; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
      <p> In this monthly breakdown by borough, we see patterns of peaks and dips. Spring surges, summer slowdowns, and end-of-year dips. This isn’t just academic: it may reflect staff scheduling, budget cycles, or strategic enforcement periods. Understanding these cycles allows policymakers to better allocate resources and helps restaurants anticipate inspections. Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens have the highest volumes, suggesting a higher concentration of establishments or targeted activity.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>What about day-to-day patterns?</h2>
      <p>Zooming in further, we explore how inspections vary over the days of the week and calendar year.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/inspections.png" alt="Inspection Occurrences Heatmap">
      <p> Midweek days, especially Tuesday through Thursday, have the highest inspection counts. Weekends are rarely used. This suggests that inspections are aligned with business hours, staffing schedules, or policy constraints.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where Are the Safe Restaurants?</h2>
      <p>Our next question is spatial: where are the best (and worst) performing restaurants? This interactive map displays restaurant grades across the city.</p>
      <iframe src="assets/interactive/NYC_Restaurant_Locations_and_Inspection_Grades.html" style="width: 1108.5px; height: 718.5px; border: none; overflow: hidden; display: block; margin-left: 20; margin-right: 50;"></iframe>
      <p>While ‘A’ grades dominate, some neighborhoods show higher proportions of ‘B’ and ‘C’ grades. These spatial patterns may hint at resource inequalities, infrastructure challenges, or concentrated enforcement.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Borough by Borough: Who Gets Inspected the Most?</h2>
      <p>Next, we step back to see how inspection volume has changed over the past decade in each borough.</p>
      <iframe src="assets/interactive/Yearly_Restaurant_Inspections_in_Each_Borough.html" style="width: 100%; height: 920px; border: none; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
      <p> There is a significant dip in inspections around 2020—unsurprisingly due to the pandemic. Recovery is uneven, and Manhattan leads consistently in volume. This may reflect both density and the concentration of food businesses.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What kinds of restaurants get inspected more?</h2>
      <p>Cuisine types are not inspected equally. Some are more common, some face more violations, and some shift dramatically over time.</p>
      <iframe src="assets/interactive/NYC_Restaurant_Inspections_Over_Time_by_Cuisine.html" style="width: 1108px; height: 680px; border: none; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
      <p>Chinese and American cuisines have consistently high inspection counts. Newer cuisines like Latin or Japanese gain traction in later years. Inspection frequencies might reflect cuisine popularity, risk categories, or public scrutiny.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What kinds of violations do cuisines get?</h2>
      <p>Beyond frequency, the severity of violations tells us even more. Here we compare critical and non-critical violations across the top 10 cuisine types.</p>
      <iframe src="assets/interactive/top_10_cuisine_types_by_critical_non_critical_violations.html" style="width: 700px; height: 730px; border: none; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
      <p>Chinese cuisine shows a higher number of critical violations, while others like Pizza or Latin are more balanced. This could indicate differences in food preparation processes, inspection criteria, or systemic bias.</p>

      <p>From time to place to cuisine, inspection patterns reveal much about how New York City works. Inspections don’t happen in a vacuum — they follow schedules, trace city politics, and mirror cultural change.By analyzing and visualizing this data, we not only improve food safety, but uncover the deeper patterns of the city’s everyday life. Next time you see a grade on a restaurant window, you’ll know a little more about the complex system behind it.</p>
